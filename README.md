A simple website

I need a Design for a Website Home Page and one standard inner page layout.
The design should have a clean, modern look, appropriate for a professional medical provider. Typography, imagery and color theme should give off a sterile, contemporary feel, with a simplified user interface and a layout that is easy to navigate, ultimately creating an ideal user experience for the end-user.

See attached full details, and logo
